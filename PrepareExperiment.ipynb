The scene is a bustling urban environment with sleek, modern high-rises and palm trees lining the street. The sky is clear and bright, with intense sunlight casting sharp shadows. The street is lively, with well-dressed pedestrians and luxury cars gliding past. The buildings have glass facades, reflecting the sunlight, and some have rooftop gardens.

The scene is a snowy urban environment with imposing Soviet-era buildings and bare trees coated in frost. The sky is overcast, casting a dull gray light over the streets. The road is slushy, with ordinary sedans and compact cars moving slowly. A few bundled-up pedestrians trudge through the snow, their breath visible in the cold air. The buildings have sturdy, utilitarian designs with few decorative elements. The person in the video is wearing a thick winter coat and gloves, either walking carefully or standing still in the chilly weather.*  \n",

The scene is a charming Parisian street lined with elegant Haussmann-style buildings, their wrought-iron balconies adorned with flower boxes. The sky has light clouds, allowing soft sunlight to filter through. The street is lively with well-dressed locals and tourists, and the cars—mostly compact and stylish—are impeccably clean. Cafés spill out onto the sidewalks, and the scent of fresh bread lingers in the air. The person in the video is wearing a light jacket, strolling leisurely or pausing to take in the view.*  \n",

The scene is a wet London street with classic red-brick townhouses and black cabs splashing through puddles. The sky is heavy with rain, and the golden leaves on the pavement are soggy. The cars are mostly vintage models or boxy sedans, their headlights glowing in the dim light. Pedestrians hurry under umbrellas, their coats damp from the drizzle. The buildings have tall windows and ornate details, some with ivy creeping up the walls. The person in the video is wearing a trench coat, walking briskly or waiting at a crosswalk.*  \n",
