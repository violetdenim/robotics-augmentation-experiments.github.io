The video is taken from a first-person perspective, likely with a camera mounted on the person's head or chest. The setting appears to be a city street with buildings on either side. The sky is overcast, and the lighting is dim, suggesting it could be early morning or late afternoon. The street is mostly empty, with a few pedestrians visible in the distance. The buildings have a modern architectural style, with large windows and neutral-colored facades. The person's hand is visible in the foreground, holding what appears to be a camera or phone.
